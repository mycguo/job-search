    "job_description": "[2025-11-06 22:19] Company Size: Team: About 60 employees - mostly AI researchers and engineers focused on infrastructure, data training, and algorithm development Founded: March 2024 (less than 2 years old) Location: Brooklyn/New York Financial Scale: Valuation: $8 billion (as of October 2024) Total Funding: $2.15 billion, including:  $25M seed round (led by Sequoia Capital and CRV) $105M Series A $2B mega-round in October 2024 (led by Nvidia)  This represents a 15x valuation increase in just 7 months. Notable Backers: Nvidia, Sequoia, Lightspeed, CRV, Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO), Eric Yuan (Zoom founder), DST Global, and others What They Do: Founded by two former Google DeepMind researchers (Misha Laskin and Ioannis Antonoglou who worked on Gemini and AlphaGo), Reflection AI is positioning itself as an open-source alternative to closed frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, and as a \"Western answer to DeepSeek.\" They haven't released their first model yet - it's planned for early 2025 - but they've built infrastructure to train massive frontier-scale AI models. So while the team is still quite small at 60 people, they're financially one of the most well-funded AI startups in history.",
